Installing
----------

Meteodata-monitor is packaged with the autotools so installing can be as simple as

    ./configure; make; make install

You need some Boost libraries: System and Program options, at least
version 1.52, as well as the Cassandra cpp driver version 2 (which is shipped as
a submodule in this repository).
